# PalindromeCheckerApp
This project explores various ways to check for palindromes in Java, starting from basic strings and moving into advanced data structures.
Project Evolution (UC1 - UC13)
Foundation: Started with a welcome message (UC1) and simple hardcoded checks (UC2).

Basic Logic: Used for loops to reverse strings (UC3) and optimized memory with Two-Pointers and char[] (UC4).

Linear Data Structures: Applied Stacks for LIFO logic (UC5), compared Stacks vs. Queues (UC6), and used Deques for double-ended access (UC7).

Advanced Structures: Built a Linked List checker using midpoint discovery (UC8) and implemented Recursion for a divide-and-conquer approach (UC9).

Real-World Handling: Added Regex to ignore spaces and case sensitivity (UC10).

Design Patterns: Refactored into an OOP Service (UC11) and implemented the Strategy Pattern to swap algorithms at runtime (UC12).

Performance: Benchmarked all methods using System.nanoTime() to find the most efficient solution (UC13).
