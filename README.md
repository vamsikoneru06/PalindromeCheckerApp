# PalindromeCheckerApp
* **Goal: Use a Stack data structure to reverse characters and validate a palindrome.
* Logic:
* Push: Insert each character of the string into the stack.
* Pop & Compare: Remove characters from the stack (returns them in reverse order) and compare them to the original string.
* Result: If all characters match, the input is a palindrome.
* Technical Details
* LIFO Principle: Stack follows Last In First Out, which naturally reverses the sequence.
* Data Structure: Uses the java.util.Stack collection.
* Operations: Leverages push() to add and pop() to retrieve/remove elements.
* Quick Commands
* Compile: javac UseCase5PalindromeCheckerApp.java
* Run: java UseCase5PalindromeCheckerApp**
