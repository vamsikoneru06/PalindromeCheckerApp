# PalindromeCheckerApp
Goal: Validate a palindrome using a Singly Linked List structure.

The Logic:

Conversion: The input string is converted into a dynamic list of nodes.

Midpoint Discovery: Uses the Fast and Slow Pointer technique to find the center of the list efficiently.

In-Place Reversal: The second half of the linked list is reversed to allow for direct comparison with the first half.

Symmetric Comparison: Both halves are traversed simultaneously to check for matching characters.

Technical Details

Data Structure: Singly Linked List.

Efficiency: Demonstrates how to handle dynamic data without the random access benefits of an array.
