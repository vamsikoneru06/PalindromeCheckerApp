# PalindromeCheckerApp
Goal: Demonstrate basic palindrome validation using a predefined string.
Logic: Initialize a String Literal (e.g., "madam").
Loop: Iterate only until half of the string length to compare characters from both ends.
Comparison: Check if characters at symmetric positions match.
Result: Use an if-else statement to determine and print the outcome.
Key Technical Concepts
String: A built-in class used to store the textual data for checking.
Static Keyword: Allows the JVM to run the main() method without creating a class object.
Efficiency: The loop-to-half approach introduces fundamental comparison logic before moving to advanced structures.
