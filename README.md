Goal: Demonstrate the behavioral difference between FIFO and LIFO structures.

The Logic:

Queue (FIFO): Characters are removed in the same order they were added (starts from the beginning).

Stack (LIFO): Characters are removed in reverse order (starts from the end).

Comparison: By comparing the "First-In" from the Queue with the "Last-In" from the Stack, you perform a symmetric check.

Data Structures: Uses java.util.Queue (via LinkedList) and java.util.Stack.
